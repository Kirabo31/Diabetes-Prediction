# Diabetes-Prediction
In this article, we will develop two machine learning models for predicting diabetes risk early on in one's life. We will use the early stage diabetes risk prediction dataset which can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Diabetes is a lifelong disease that keeps your body away from using insulin. Early detection of the disease can help people avoid the chronic illness.
